## PuzzleFAB Web Player

PuzzleFAB is a pattern language for abstract single-player games and puzzles, plus a Unity player. See [blog](http://www.polyomino.com/PuzzleFAB).

PuzzleFAB implements a pattern language compatible with PuzzleScript, an incredibly ingenious creation of Stephen Lavelle. 
More on the [blog](http://www.polyomino.com/puzzlescript) or [here](https://www.puzzlescript.net).
PuzzleFAB has a compiler, a universal games engine and a player targeting Unity. 
This in turn can be used to create players for almost any platform: Windows desktop, Linux, WebGL, Android, iOS and so on.

This is the Web Player, for anyone to use. Just click the link and enjoy!.

The default game is [2048](https://david-pfx.github.io/PuzzleFABweb/WebGL), showing mouse clicks, text and high res objects.

Press Escape and the Pause screen allows you to select other games.
