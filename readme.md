## Puzzlang Web Player

Puzzlang is a pattern language for abstract single-player games and puzzles, and a Unity player. See http://www.polyomino.com/puzzlang.

Puzzlang implements a pattern language compatible with PuzzleScript, an incredibly ingenious creation of Stephen Lavelle. More at http://www.polyomino.com/puzzlescript and www.puzzlescript.net. Puzzlang has a compiler, a universal games engine and a player targeting Unity. This in turn can be used to create players for almost any platform: Windows desktop, Linux, WebGL, Android, iOS and so on.

This is the Web Player, for anyone to use.
